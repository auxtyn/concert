            I will enter his gates by Zitu Benafa
          </h1>
          <p className="subtext mb-5 text-center text-2xl">
            I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart;
            <br />
            I will enter His courts with praise.
            <br />
            I will say this is the day that the Lord has made.
            <br />
            I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
            <br />
            He has made me glad, He has made me glad,
            <br />
            I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
            <br />
            He has made me glad, He has made me glad,
            <br />I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

            <span className="text-cyan-100">Verse 1</span> Joyful, joyful, we
            adore You,
            <br />
            God of glory, Lord of love;
            <br />
            Hearts unfold like flow'rs before You,
            <br />
            Op'ning to the sun above.
            <br />
            Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
            <br />
            Drive the dark of doubt away;
            <br />
            Giver of immortal gladness,
            <br />
            Fill us with the light of day!
            <br />
            2 All Your works with joy surround You, Earth and heav'n reflect
            Your rays, Stars and angels sing around You, Center of unbroken
            praise; Field and forest, vale and mountain, Flow'ry meadow,
            flashing sea, Chanting bird and flowing fountain Praising You
            eternally! <br />
            3 Always giving and forgiving, Ever blessing, ever blest,
            Well-spring of the joy of living, Ocean-depth of happy rest! Loving
            Father, Christ our Brother, Let Your light upon us shine; Teach us
            how to love each other, Lift us to the joy divine. <br />4 Mortals,
            join the mighty chorus, Which the morning stars began; God's own
            love is reigning oâ€™er us, Joining people hand in hand. Ever singing,
            march we onward, Victors in the midst of strife; Joyful music leads
            us sunward In the triumph song of life.
